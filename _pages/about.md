Allow me to introduce myself â€“ I'm Bilal Ahmed, an inquisitive researcher hailing from the vibrant city of West Lafayette, Indiana. My journey into the intriguing realm of auditory cortex modeling is a testament to my unwavering passion for understanding the human mind.

My academic voyage began at Purdue University in 2021, where I embarked on a profound quest as a Graduate Research Assistant. Here, I immerse myself in the world of deep learning, with a particular focus on modeling the auditory cortex. My work involves the intricate training of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for speech-to-text recognition, a task that calls for the computational prowess of up to 8 GPUs. Diving even deeper, I've harnessed the vast LibriSpeech dataset, which spans an astonishing 960 hours of speech data. Yet, what truly captivates me is the analysis of neural data, painstakingly recorded from the auditory cortex of macaque monkeys.

Before my academic endeavors, my journey in Pakistan unfolded with a dynamic career at Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited. From 2015 to 2021, I wore many hats, starting as an Automation Engineer. As time progressed, I found myself leading teams of up to 8 technical staff members, overseeing diverse tasks. My responsibilities ranged from preventive maintenance at utilities plants to spearheading system upgrades and reliability enhancement projects. A standout accomplishment was optimizing the speed governor at a steam turbine, leading to an impressive 8% efficiency boost. Additionally, I proudly took on leadership roles beyond engineering, such as leading the E&I department's fire-fighting squad to victory during annual competitions.

My journey extends to my homeland, where I served as a Research Intern at the AL-KHAWARAZMI INSTITUTE OF COMPUTER SCIENCE. Here, I played a vital role in a project dedicated to developing and installing solar reflectors at a heliostat power plant. My tasks were as diverse as they were engaging, from PCB design to soldering, electrical testing, and programming microcontrollers using C language.

In the academic realm, I'm excited to share that I have a manuscript currently under review for NeurIPS-2023, titled "Deep Neural Networks Explain Single-Cell Activity in Auditory Cortex." I've also had the privilege of presenting my research at COSYNE 2023 in Montreal, Canada, where my poster, titled "Understanding Auditory Cortex with Deep Neural Networks," garnered acclaim.

Beyond the professional arena, I've been fortunate to receive the National ICT R&D Scholarship, which fully funded my Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from 2011 to 2015. I'm deeply committed to giving back to the community and have dedicated significant time to career counseling for school children in rural areas of Pakistan from 2015 to 2020.

Outside the world of research and engineering, I find joy in the pages of books, particularly those exploring investing, economics, and business. Sports also hold a special place in my heart, with cricket and badminton being my chosen outlets for leisure and recreation.

Thank you for joining me on this captivating journey through my academic and professional life. If you'd like to connect, explore research collaborations, or simply share ideas, please don't hesitate to reach out.
