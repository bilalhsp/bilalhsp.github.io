## 👋 About Me

I am a PhD student in **Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)** at **Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN**. Previously, I worked for over 5 years as a Maintenance Engineer in a manufacturing facility in Pakistan, where I developed a strong interest in **Machine Learning**.

My research focuses on:

- Modeling the **auditory cortex** in squirrel monkeys using pretrained deep learning models.  
  Manuscript: [Deep Neural Networks Explain Spiking Activity in Auditory Cortex](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013334)  

- Applying **diffusion models** as priors for audio models to better understand and explain their behavior.  

I am also interested in:

- **Generative models**, **computer vision**, and **probabilistic modeling**  
- Exploring applications of AI in real-world problems  

I am currently **learning numerical solutions of ODEs** and diving deeper into **self-supervised and generative modeling techniques**.  

I am open to **internship opportunities** to further explore these areas.



<!-- I am a graduate student doing PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN. 
I have experience of more than 5 years of working as Maintenance Engineer in a manufacturing facility in Pakistan. During that time, I developed an interest in Machine Learning so I decided to pursue that. I started my PhD in Fall 2021, and my first project was on modelling the auditory cortex in squirrel monkeys using pretrained deep learning models. Manuscript is uploaded on bioRxiv [link here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.12.623280v1.abstract) and sent out for review.   
I am currently working on application of diffusion models as priors for Audio models. The goal is to explain/interpret the audio models with the help of audio diffusion models. Other than my ongoing work, I have keen interest in generative models, computer vision, 
probabilistic modelling, and their applications.  
I am looking for internship opportunities to explore my interest further. -->
