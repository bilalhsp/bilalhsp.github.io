I am a PhD student in **AI & Neuroscience** at **Purdue University** (West Lafayette, IN). Prior to starting my PhD, I worked for over five years as an **Instrumentation & Control Engineer** in a manufacturing facility in Pakistan, where I developed a strong interest in machine learning and data-driven problem solving.

### 🔬 My Research Focus
- 🔄 Solving inverse problems using **diffusion models** as priors.
- 🧠 Modeling the **auditory cortex** in squirrel monkeys using pretrained deep learning models.  
  Manuscript: [Deep Neural Networks Explain Spiking Activity in Auditory Cortex](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013334)

### 🌟 Interests

- 🤖 **Generative models** & **computational imaging**  
- 🌍 Exploring applications of AI in real-world problems  

---

### 💼 Opportunities

I am currently seeking Summer 2026 internship opportunities in inverse problems, computational imaging, and generative modeling. I expect to graduate in Summer 2026 and am open to research positions in both industry and academia thereafter.
