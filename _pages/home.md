        I am doing PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN. I have experience of more than 5 years of working as a Maintenance Engineer in a manufacturing facility in Pakistan. During that time, I developed an interest in Machine Learning, so I decided to pursue it. My first project was on modelling the auditory cortex in squirrel monkeys using pretrained deep learning models. Manuscript is uploaded on bioRxiv 
        <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.12.623280v1.abstract" target="_blank">[link here]</a> and sent out for review.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am currently working on application of diffusion models as priors for audio models. The goal is to explain the audio models with the help of audio diffusion models. Other than my ongoing work, I have keen interest in generative models, computer vision, probabilistic modelling, and their applications.  
        I am looking for internship opportunities to explore my interest further.
